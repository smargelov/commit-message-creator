# Creating Commit Messages with AI

## Welcome to the Commit Message Generator

This tool helps generate commit messages for your code changes. It uses AI to analyze your code and suggests appropriate commit messages based on the changes made. This can save your time and effort when writing commit messages and help ensure clarity and informativeness of commit history.

You can also connect to Jira for automatic task description addition to the prompt. (Specify the task prefix in settings. The task number with prefix should be specified in the current branch name. For example: \`feature/ABC-1234\` or \`MD-1234-some-task\`)

## How to Use

1. **Just press the keyboard shortcut** \`⌘\` \`↲\` to generate a commit message for the current branch of selected directory.
2. **After generating the commit message**, simply copy it (press \`⌘\` \`↲\` again) and paste it into the commit message.
3. **If you don't have Raycast AI connected**, instead of a commit you'll get a generated prompt for any AI model convenient for you

It's all. It was easy, wasn't it?
